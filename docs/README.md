## [Watara Supervision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watara_Supervision) Compatible Gateware IP Core

This Implementation of a compatible Watara Supervision hardware in HDL is the work of [Pierre Cornier](https://github.com/pcornier) and [Jamie Blanks](https://github.com/Kitrinx).

## Overview

The Watara Supervision, also known as the QuickShot Supervision in the UK, is a monochrome handheld game console which was introduced in 1992 as a low-cost competitor for Nintendo's Game Boy. It came packaged with a game called Crystball, which is similar to Breakout. One unique feature of the Supervision was that it could be linked up to a television via a link cable. Games played in this way would display in four colors, much like Nintendo's Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES. A full color TV link was also in the works, but because of the Supervision's failure to make a major impression among gamers it was cancelled, along with the games which were in development for it. Only a tiny handful of games were developed by third parties and many were developed in Taiwan or Hong Kong.

## Technical specifications

- The CPU is an 8-bit WDC 65C02 processor.
- The Supervision screen is 2.37 inches x 2.37 inches, or 160 pixels x 160 pixels. It uses an LCD that can display 4 monochrome shades.
- The unit is powered by 4 AA batteries or a 6V AC/DC adapter.
- The unit includes a cartridge port, contrast dial, and a DB-9 connector port for multiplayer.
- Sound is handled by 4 tonal and 1 Noise channel plus an additional DMA stereo output channel via the - built-in speaker or the headphone jack. Volume is controlled with a dial.

## Usage
